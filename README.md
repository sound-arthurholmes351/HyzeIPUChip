## 🌟 Key Highlights

| Feature | Performance / Specification |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Inference Latency** | **0.04μs per token** (1250x faster than traditional GPUs) |
| **Compute Density** | **8 TOPS** on Lattice ECP5; **100k TOPS** at rack-scale |
| **Cold Start** | **0ms** via WASM-optimized serverless edge runtime |
| **Context Window** | Supports up to **10M tokens** via context streaming |
| **Power Efficiency** | **5W TDP** for edge inference (60x more efficient than 300W GPUs) |
| **Security** | Hardware-level **Prompt Guard**, **Confidential Enclaves**, and **Quantum-Safe Crypto** |

## 🏗️ Architecture Stack

The Hyze ecosystem spans from silicon to the cloud, providing a full-stack solution for AI deployment.

### 1. Hardware Layer (RTL)
- **NPU Core**: A high-performance neural processing unit optimized for quantized 8-bit inference.
- **Safety FSM**: Real-time hardware-level prompt filtering and jailbreak detection.
- **DMA Controller**: High-speed data movement between SRAM and host memory.
- **Truth Engine**: Hardware-accelerated verification of model outputs.

### 2. Driver & Runtime Layer
- **Rust Host Driver**: Safe and concurrent host-to-device communication via USB/PCIe.
- **ONNX Compiler**: A custom toolchain that compiles ONNX models directly into synthesizable Verilog.
- **Multi-modal Runtime**: Unified execution environment for text, image, and audio processing.

### 3. Enterprise & Cloud Layer
- **Serverless Edge**: WASM-based inference for Cloudflare Workers and edge nodes.
- **Orchestrator**: Rack-scale management of 64-tile IPU clusters and GPU offloading.
- **Secure Controllers**: Java/Spring Boot based management plane with Istio service mesh integration.

## 🛡️ Security & Compliance

Hyze IPU is built with a **Security-First** philosophy:
- **Hardware Prompt Guard**: Blocks malicious prompts (jailbreaks, PII leaks) at the gate-level with zero software overhead.
- **Confidential Enclaves**: TEE-based execution for sensitive model weights and user data.
- **SBOM Enforcer**: Real-time verification of software components to prevent supply-chain attacks.
- **Quantum-Safe Crypto**: Future-proof encryption for all data-in-transit and data-at-rest.
